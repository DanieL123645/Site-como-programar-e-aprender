       <h1>HTML</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>certainly very confusing as everyone says that html is a programming language like python c# c++</p>
       <p>html is actually a markup language that works alongside css and javascript and php</p>
       <p>I won't give you a complete course but I can more or less teach you</p>
       <h2>codes</h2>
       <p>First you should learn that the first line of code has to be &lt;DOCTYPE html&gt; or if you are using vs code and just press ! and then ENTER that way you put the first lines of code</p>
       <p>then put other lines of code</p>
       <p>there are several code to put in your program like:</p>
       <h3>&lt;div&gt; an item like a square</h3>
       <h3>&lt;h1&gt; level 1 text going up to 6</h3>
       <h3>&lt;span&gt; text/square or item that can be a circle too</h3>
       <h3>&lt;head&gt; top / site settings</h3>
       <h3>&lt;body&gt; part of the site with the items and texts</h3>
       <h3>&lt;title&gt; website title/name</h3>
       <h3>&lt;ol&gt; correlated lists</h3>
       <h3>&lt;p&gt; paragraph</h3>
       <h3>&lt;a&gt; text however is used to make links</h3>
       <h3>&lt;br&gt; line break</h3>

       <h1>python</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>python the snake language is the easiest I know</p>
       <p>I remember my first python code and it was</p>
       <p>print('Olá, Mundo')</p>
       <p>I consider python simple and easy to learn, it just makes it a little difficult when you start messing with libraries</p>
       <p>In python there are several libraries like:</p>
       <h3>pyautogui: made to automate your computer</h3>
       <h4>pygame: made to create games</h4>
       <h3>os: I don't know what it's for</h3>
       <br>
       <p>python has many functions like automate a computer create a game create an application</p>
       <h5>hey do you want a python course I know 3 are below</h5>

       <h1>javascript</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>javascript is good for creating websites as well as html and css unlike html and css javascript is a programming language</p>
       <p>different from own html</p>
       <h4>I don't know what javascript does, I only know how to create a game</h4>

       <br>
       <h1>c#</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>c# for sure the language that everyone uses to create game</p>
       <p>and something else if you write c# but if you read c sharp</p>
       <p>you have to know how to read the name of the language</p>
       <p>c# and the language used to program in unity</p>
       <p>unity is a game creation engine</p>
       <p>as I have nothing more to say about c#</p>
       <br>
       <h1>java</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>java a language that can create games too</p>
       <p>which as far as I know was the language used in the creation of minecraft</p>
       <p>with java you can even do artificial intelligence just like python</p>
       <p>and also network applications</p>
       <h1>php</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>php is a language that can also be used to make websites</p>
       <p> you can collect data from forms, generate pages with dynamic content or send and receive cookies with this php</p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dlFPrCXCmd5g92860x_Pbr_" target="_blank" rel="external">PHP Course</a>
       <h1>C</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>C can be used in arduino programming</p>
       <p>Can also be used in application creation</p>
       <p>And yes, there are several versions of the C: language</p>
       <p>C, C#, C++</p>
       <h1>EXTRAS</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>perhaps you are wondering where c where c++ php and stuff</p>
       <p>but so far I haven't put it, maybe I'll put it in other languages later</p>
       <h2>error box</h2>
       <p>what to troll that friend of yours after making a fake error box</p>
       <p>you just need a computer, notepad/notepad and so</p>
       <p>first open notepad/notepad</p>
       <p>press windows+R</p>
       <p>and so you open the execute</p>
       <p>after opening this type notepad and that way you open notepad</p>
        <p>or open it another way I just showed you a way to open it</p>
        <h4>example: x=msgbox("message",Button+icon, "title")</h4>
        <p>you will do something like this </p>
        <p>choose a button for your error message like ok</p>
        <ul>buttons
         <li>0 Ok</li>
         <li>1 Ok and Cancel</li>
         <li>2 Abort, Retry, and Ignore</li>
         <li>3 Yes, No and Cancel</li>
         <li>4 Yes and No</li>
         <li>5 Retry and Cancel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>you copy what I leave in the example</p>
        <p>where there is a Button, you place one of these five</p>
        <ul>icon
         <li>0 without icon</li>
         <li>16 critical error("X")</li>
         <li>32 question mark ("?")</li>
         <li>48 warning ("!")</li>
         <li>64 information ("i")</li>
        </ul>
        <p>put one of these numbers where there is an icon</p>
        <p>where it has a title, put whatever you want for your error box with warning I'll hack you</p>
        <p>and where there is a message, put the message you want like I'm going to hack you</p>
        <p>x=msgbox("A virus has been detected on your computer",0+48, "Warning")</p>
        <p>example of an error box </p>
        <p>then save as ai choose a name after putting the name write .vbs</p>
        <p>set text type as ANSI</p>
        <p>click on all the files and that's it and just save</p>
